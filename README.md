#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a systematic approach used to develop, operation and maintenance of software
In the Technology industry it entails activiities like quality assurance; it ensures that software products are reliable. efficient. and meet user requirements ,Scalability' designing systems that can handle increased loads without compromising perfomance, Cost efficiency; by following a structred approach, software engineering helps in identifying potential issues early in the development process, reducing the cost of fixing bugs and making changes later, Security; ensuring that software is robust against vulnerabilities considering the increasing threat of cyber-attacks, Innovation; the field drives innovation by enabling the devlopment of new technologies and applications.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.The Advent of High-Level Programming Languages
Description: The development of high-level programming languages such as FORTRAN and COBOL allowing developers to write code that was more human-readable and easier to maintain,developers could aslo write programs more quickly and with fewer errors and Programs written in these languages could be run on different types of hardware with minimal changes ,increasinf the portability of software.
2.The Software crisis and the Birth of Software Engineering (1968)
Description: The complexity of Software projects was leading to cost overruns, missed deadlines and unreliable products thus marking the formal recognition of software engineering as a distinct discipline ,leading to the development of structured programming and othe rmethodologies aimed at improving software quality and manageability.The establishment of software engineering as a field led to the creation of professional standards, certifications, and educational programs. 
3.The Rise of Agile Methodologies
Description:There was Introduction of a set of principles for Software development that emphasized flexibility ,customer collaboration and Iterative progress.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Requirements Gathering: Understand and document what the software needs to do .
2.Design Plan: Plan the architeculture, components and user interfaces.
3.Implementation(Coding): Write the actual code based on the design.
4.Testing: Verify that the Software works as Intended and fix bugs.
5.Deployment: Release the software to users.
6.Maintenance: Improve the Software over time.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methodology: a Linear, sequential approach where each phase (requirements ,design, implementation, testing,deployment) is completed before moving to the next. It is rigid and structured, requirements are defined upfrontand changes are difficult to accomodate and it is well suited for projects with clear, unchanging requirements e.g. Building a Bridge or a Government system with fixed specifications.
Agile Methodology: An Iterative, flexible approach where software is developed in small ,incremental cycles (sprints), Emphasizes collaboration ,customer feedback, and adaptability e.g. Developing a video game with frequent updates.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
 1. Software Developer:
Role: Writes and maintains code.
Responsibilities:
Develop software features based on requirements.
Debug and fix issues.
Collaborate with team members on design and implementation.
 2. Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer:
Role: Ensures software quality.
Responsibilities:
Design and execute test cases.
Identify and report bugs.
Verify fixes and ensure the software meets quality standards.
3. Project Manager:
Role: Oversees project execution.
Responsibilities:
Plan and schedule project tasks.
Coordinate team efforts and resources.
Monitor progress and ensure timely delivery.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Importance: Streamlines coding by providing tools like code editors, debuggers, and compilers in one interface e.g. Visual Studio
Version Control Systems (VCS): Tracks changes, enables collaboration, and prevents code loss e.g. Git (with platforms like GitHub, GitLab).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1.Changing Requirements:
 Challenge: Requirements often evolve during development.
 Strategy: Use Agile methodologies to adapt quickly and involve stakeholders regularly.
2.Tight Deadlines:
Challenge: Pressure to deliver quickly can compromise quality.
Strategy: Prioritize tasks using MoSCoW method (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won't-have) and automate repetitive tasks.
3.Technical Debt:
Challenge: Accumulation of quick fixes leads to long-term issues.
Strategy: Regularly refactor code and allocate time for tech debt sprints.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
    Unit Testing, Tests individual components or functions.Importance: Ensures each part works correctly in isolation.
    Integration Testing: Tests interactions between integrated components or systems.Importance: Verifies that combined parts work together as expected.
    System Testing:Tests the complete system as a whole.Importance: Ensures the entire system meets specified requirements.
    Acceptance Testing:Tests the system against user requirements and business needs.Importance: Confirms the software is ready for deployment and use by end-users.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Definition: Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining inputs (prompts) to effectively guide AI models, like ChatGPT, to produce desired outputs.
Importance:
Accuracy: Well-crafted prompts improve the relevance and accuracy of AI responses.
Efficiency: Reduces trial-and-error, saving time and resources.
Control: Allows users to steer AI behavior toward specific goals or contexts.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: "Tell me about history."
Improved Prompt: "Summarize the causes and key events of World War II in 100 words."
Why Improved Prompt is Effective
 Clear: Specifies the topic (World War II).
 Specific: Focuses on causes and key events.
 Concise: Limits the response to 100 words,

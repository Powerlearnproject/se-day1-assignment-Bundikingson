### Question 2
**Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.**

**Answer**:  
1. **The Advent of High-Level Programming Languages**:  
   - Description: The development of high-level programming languages such as FORTRAN and COBOL allowed developers to write code that was more human-readable and easier to maintain.  
   - Impact: Increased portability of software and faster development with fewer errors.  

2. **The Software Crisis and the Birth of Software Engineering (1968)**:  
   - Description: The complexity of software projects led to cost overruns, missed deadlines, and unreliable products.  
   - Impact: Marked the formal recognition of software engineering as a discipline, leading to structured programming and professional standards.  

3. **The Rise of Agile Methodologies**:  
   - Description: Introduced principles emphasizing flexibility, customer collaboration, and iterative progress.  
   - Impact: Enabled faster adaptation to changing requirements and improved software quality.

### Question 3
**List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.**

**Answer**:  
1. **Requirements Gathering**: Understand and document what the software needs to do.  
2. **Design**: Plan the architecture, components, and user interfaces.  
3. **Implementation (Coding)**: Write the actual code based on the design.  
4. **Testing**: Verify that the software works as intended and fix bugs.  
5. **Deployment**: Release the software to users.  
6. **Maintenance**: Improve the software over time.

### Question 4
**Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.**

**Answer**:  
- **Waterfall Methodology**:  
  - A linear, sequential approach where each phase (requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment) is completed before moving to the next.  
  - **Strengths**: Rigid and structured, well-suited for projects with clear, unchanging requirements.  
  - **Example**: Building a bridge or a government system with fixed specifications.  

- **Agile Methodology**:  
  - An iterative, flexible approach where software is developed in small, incremental cycles (sprints).  
  - **Strengths**: Emphasizes collaboration, customer feedback, and adaptability.  
  - **Example**: Developing a video game with frequent updates.

### Question 5
**Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.**

**Answer**:  
1. **Software Developer**:  
   - **Role**: Writes and maintains code.  
   - **Responsibilities**:  
     - Develop software features based on requirements.  
     - Debug and fix issues.  
     - Collaborate with team members on design and implementation.  

2. **Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer**:  
   - **Role**: Ensures software quality.  
   - **Responsibilities**:  
     - Design and execute test cases.  
     - Identify and report bugs.  
     - Verify fixes and ensure the software meets quality standards.  

3. **Project Manager**:  
   - **Role**: Oversees project execution.  
   - **Responsibilities**:  
     - Plan and schedule project tasks.  
     - Coordinate team efforts and resources.  
     - Monitor progress and ensure timely delivery.

### Question 6
**Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.**

**Answer**:  
- **Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)**:  
  - **Importance**: Streamlines coding by providing tools like code editors, debuggers, and compilers in one interface.  
  - **Examples**: Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm.  

- **Version Control Systems (VCS)**:  
  - **Importance**: Tracks changes, enables collaboration, and prevents code loss.  
  - **Examples**: Git (with platforms like GitHub, GitLab), Subversion (SVN).

---

### Question 7
**What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.**

**Answer**:  
1. **Changing Requirements**:  
   - **Challenge**: Requirements often evolve during development.  
   - **Strategy**: Use Agile methodologies to adapt quickly and involve stakeholders regularly.  

2. **Tight Deadlines**:  
   - **Challenge**: Pressure to deliver quickly can compromise quality.  
   - **Strategy**: Prioritize tasks using the MoSCoW method (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won't-have) and automate repetitive tasks.  

3. **Technical Debt**:  
   - **Challenge**: Accumulation of quick fixes leads to long-term issues.  
   - **Strategy**: Regularly refactor code and allocate time for tech debt sprints.

### Question 8
**Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.**

**Answer**:  
1. **Unit Testing**:  
   - Tests individual components or functions.  
   - **Importance**: Ensures each part works correctly in isolation.  

2. **Integration Testing**:  
   - Tests interactions between integrated components or systems.  
   - **Importance**: Verifies that combined parts work together as expected.  

3. **System Testing**:  
   - Tests the complete system as a whole.  
   - **Importance**: Ensures the entire system meets specified requirements.  

4. **Acceptance Testing**:  
   - Tests the system against user requirements and business needs.  
   - **Importance**: Confirms the software is ready for deployment and use by end-users.

## Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

### Question 9
**Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.**

**Answer**:
